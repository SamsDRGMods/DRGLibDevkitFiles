# modTemplate
A boilerplate UE project to start a mod with

- Disables .pak file
- Disables share material shader code
- Disables Unnescessary plugins (Stop starting Steamvr, dangit!)
- Is named FSD(This helps with DRG compatibility)

Note: I strongly recommend keeping the name of your project as FSD. This can help compatibility with DRG in certain situations. While the project name should stay as FSD, you **can** rename the folder the project is sitting in. (FSD to MyMod, for example)
